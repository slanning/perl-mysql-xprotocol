Normally I distribute CPAN code "under the same license as Perl itself",
which includes the choice of the Artistic License. However, since a lot
of this code is generated from or derived from GPL v2 code,
I think it's better/safer to assume it's GPL v2.

The file Mysqlx.pm was generated from the .proto files at
https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/tree/5.7/rapid/plugin/x/protocol

The .proto files are copied into the proto directory for convenience
along with a copy of the GPL v2 license.

Some other code is derived from https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-nodejs
